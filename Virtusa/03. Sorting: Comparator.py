'''
Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array. The Player class is provided in the editor below. It has two fields:
name: a string.
score: an integer.
Given an array of n Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score. If 2 or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically ascending by name. To do this, you must create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface, then write an int compare(Player a, Player b) method implementing the Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2) method. In short, when sorting in ascending order, a comparator function returns -1 if a<b, 0 if a=b, and 1 if a>b.
